# financial-tracking-repository
A customized tracking application for my finances (receipts, invoices, bills, etc) with reports.</br></br>

For years I've used Excel to accomplish the customized tracking I needed for my finances. I'm aware of products like Quicken, but since I track the finances for both my wife and I across two countries (USA & Canada) it becomes necessary to have a very specific system.</br></br>

My intention with this project is to make data entry of my finances more user-friendly for...well...me.</br></br>

This will also give me the opportunity to practice my PHP, JavaScript, HTML5, React.js, and SQL skills.</br></br>

There will be separation of concerns in the design, as well as information security in a basic username/password login system.</br></br>

I intend, and expect, to have this project started and completed by week's end.
